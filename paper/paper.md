# DeepForestR: An R package for training and predicting individual tree crowns from airborne RGB imagery.

## Summary

## Statement of Need

A pytorch implementation of the DeepForest model for individual tree crown detection in RGB images. DeepForest is a python package for training and predicting individual tree crowns from airborne RGB imagery. DeepForest comes with a prebuilt model trained on data from the National Ecological Observatory Network. Users can extend this model by annotating and training custom models starting from the prebuilt model.

## Implementation
